## Overview
The role of the Blueshield Officer is to protect command members, that's it! You should not act as a security officer, warden, or cadet outside of preserving a command member, or if the captain appoints you to be security.

The BlueShield Officer is NOT permitted to become a Captain or Command role by rules.
